*MedLine Website Project*

Student: Ayaulym Talgatova SE-2434


The MedLine Website is a multi-page informational and educational platform focused on cancer treatment, prevention, and awareness.
It was developed as part of a web design project to demonstrate the practical use of HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap in creating a professional, responsive,
and well-structured website.

The purpose of MedLine is to help users learn about different types of cancer, available treatments, prevention strategies, and ways to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
The website aims to raise awareness about early diagnosis, modern medical technologies, and emotional support for patients and their families.

The main objectives of this project are to:

Design a five-page medical website connected through a navigation bar.

Present accurate and accessible information on cancer diagnosis and treatment methods.

Use semantic HTML5 tags for clarity and structure.

Implement Bootstrap to ensure responsive design across devices.

Apply custom CSS styling to create a professional, clean, and modern layout.

Publish the website online using GitHub Pages.

The project includes the following files:

index.html â€“ Home page, introducing the MedLine project and its purpose.

index1.html â€“ About page, describing cancer causes, symptoms, and prevention.

index2.html â€“ Treatment page, presenting available cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy.

indeex1.html â€“ Gallery / Articles page, featuring images and articles about patient stories, awareness campaigns, and medical breakthroughs.

indeex2.html â€“ Contact page, containing contact details for support and inquiries.

Each page has a consistent navigation bar and footer. Multiple CSS files (styless.css, styl1.css, styl2.css, etc.) are used to style different sections. The main image file, medical.jpeg, reflects the healthcare and oncology theme.

Technologies used:

HTML5 for semantic structure

CSS3 for custom design

Bootstrap 5 for responsiveness and grid layout

GitHub Pages for online deployment

The live version of the website can be accessed here:

Throughout the development, challenges included maintaining consistent design across multiple pages, linking stylesheets correctly, 
and ensuring responsive behavior on various screen sizes. These tasks improved understanding of front-end design and best coding practices.

The website highlights key information about:

The importance of early cancer detection

Modern treatment methods and patient care

Psychological and emotional support for patients

Preventive measures and healthy habits to reduce cancer risks

Future improvements may include adding a search bar, interactive contact form, and educational videos about cancer awareness.
A multilingual version and accessibility features could also be implemented for broader reach.

In conclusion, the MedLine Cancer Awareness Website fulfills all project requirements. It demonstrates the studentâ€™s ability to create a meaningful,
informative, and responsive website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The project not only meets technical standards but also contributes to an important global cause â€” raising awareness and hope in the fight against cancer.
